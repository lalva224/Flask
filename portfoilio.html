            <p>My name is Leandro Alvarez and I'm currently a TA here at Code Platoon. I'm currently a 3rd year Computer Science Student
                looking for good experience through internships. I am very grateful to be a part of this internship, but I'm also currently looking
                for summer internships as well.
